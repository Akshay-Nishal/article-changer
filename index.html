        <p id="text">Only by knowing the average number of friends each person has, scientists at Complexity Science Hub (CSH) were able to predict the group sizes of people in a computer game. For this purpose, they modeled the formation of social groups on an example from physics, namely the self-organization of particles with spin.People interact with each other, and groups emerge very similar to particles that form colloids or polymers. Motivated by this, the research group developed a simple model for homophilic humans that is based on the mechanisms of self-organization of particles with spin.</p>
